   A GenChain is a primary tool used by subclasses of MazeGenerator to carve paths through
   a MazeGrid. A GenChain upon which only stepNew() is called is a direct instantiation of
   the recursive backtracking algorithm. The different derivatives of MazeGenerator use
   GenChains in different ways to produce slightly different algorithms.

   A GenChain is an ArrayList of Cells
