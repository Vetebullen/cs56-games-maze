/**
   A MazeGrid holds all of the saved maze informtion. The MazeGrid has a 2D byte array
   representing each cell in the grid. Each byte in this array holds the information for
   which walls of a cell are carved open, and the markers that have been set for that cell

   Contains methods for carving paths to cells, getting cells adjacent to others by direction,
   getting information about cells in this grid, etc.

   The markers for a cell can be used in any way desired by classes that wish to work with a
   MazeGrid. For example, markers can be used to save information about which Cells have been
   visited or for marking the solution to the maze (as MazeGenerator does). MazeComponent decides how each Cell marker
   of a Cell gets drawn.
