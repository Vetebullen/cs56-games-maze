/** MultipleChainGenerator runs like a string of AltStepGenerator algorithms to create
    more complex mazes. It creates a GenChain, calling stepNew() then stepOld() in each
    call to step() until the number of cells specified by the frequency argument to the 
    MultipleChainGenerator constructor has been carved by that GenChain. At this point, a new
    GenChain is spawned from where that GenChain left off (or the next continuable cell found
    by backtracking). Each newly generated GenChain creates a new point of oirigin for carving
    paths. Many of these points of origin, or nodes for branching, will be scattered all over
    the maze, creating a much more complex maze.
