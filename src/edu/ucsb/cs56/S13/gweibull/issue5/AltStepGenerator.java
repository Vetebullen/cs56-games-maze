/** AltStepGenerator runs off the newest added cell then the oldest added cell each
    step. The maze it creates branches out in all directions from the random cell it
    starts at. The algorithm works by creating a GenChain and calling stepNew() then
    stepOld() in each call to step().

    AltStepGenerator's algorithm runs just like MultipleChainGenerator's algorithm
    when MultipleChainGenerator's frequency constructor argument is set greater
    than or equal to the area of the entire grid and the frequencyFlux constructor
    argument is set to 0.
